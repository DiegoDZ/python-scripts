# Python scripts

Important python scritps used in my doctoral thesis. Some of them were included in jupyter notebooks (Thesis/notebooks) 


__buildCt.py__ computes the matrix of covariances C(t). 

__computeLambda.py__ computes the matrix of correlations, C(t), the matrix lambda and the predicted matrix of correlations with its error.

__covariance_mm.py__ computes the covariance between two input matrix. The output is a matrix.

__covariance_mv.py__ computes the covariance between a matrix and a vector. The output is a vector.

__covariance_vm.py__ computes the covariance between a vector and a matrix. The output is a vector.

__covariance_vv.py__ computes the covariance between two input vectors. The output is a vector.

__lambda.py__ computes the matrix $\Lambda(t)$. 

__laplaceTransform.py__ computes the laplace transform of the matrix of correlations C(t).

__movie-correlations.py__ generates a movie of correlations

__movie-matrices.py__ generates a movie from an input matrix


__pbc.py__ transforms a correlations files from real to Fourier space. 

__reshapes.py__ changes format (vector/matrix) of an input file. 

__symmetrizer.py__  takes advange of the simmetries of an input matrix of correlations in order to increase the statistics.
